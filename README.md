## Overview

Creating a tip calculator that calculates the tip and the share of the bill each person has to pay depending on the tip percentage selection.

- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

I built this component in a day. Started with HTML and some basic CSS. After that I made the component work and calculate the tip with JavaScript. At the end I finished by giving it some bootstrap classes and makking it look nicer, and also making it be responsive on different screen width.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript

### What I learned

While building this project i learned how to add styles to an input placeholder. How to improvise selecting and deselecting items with setAtribute manipulation and how to add background image on an input field and make its direction from right to left.
